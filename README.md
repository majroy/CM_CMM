# CM_CMM - CMM methodology for contour method measurements
This collection of scripts/functions permits one to automate Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) programming for 'hen-peck' style measurements via MATLAB.

Simple outlines and those which contain self-restraint features are included. Documentation is included herein, as well as demonstration outlines. Input is a series of `.txt` files comprising the outline/restraint features, and the output is a `*.agw` file which has DMIS-like syntax. The output files can be directly interpreted by Mitutoyo CMMs with the ASCII MCOSMOS interpreter installed.

# Quick start
To get started, read the documentation and experiment with the main scripts, `OutlineGen.m` and `MeasMesh.m`. These have been pre-populated with demonstration outlines included in the repository.

Note that very large numbers of points, *e.g.* ~10,000, will take a long time to run; it is also recommended to install the full DistMesh code available here: http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/

# Thanks
A big thank you goes out to Per-Olof Persson for writing [Distmesh](http://persson.berkeley.edu/distmesh/) and Angus Johnson for the  [Clipper Library](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) for some really great polygon tools.

# Disclaimer & Warning
Review all code generated by this software manually prior to running on a physical system. Perform initial dry runs to avoid crashes & damage to your CMM. Use at your own risk.
